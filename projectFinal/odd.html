<h2>
  <font-family>   Stone Soup
    <pre>


    </pre>
        I’ve developed a rather 
        Odd compulsion lately.
        It seems I’ve been swallowing stones.
        All shapes and sizes, 
        I lift them up, with forced <a href="hesitation.html"> hesitation </a> 
        And I close my lips around 
        The cold, hard exterior.
        <pre>


        </pre>
        <p class="ex3">Take a skipping stone 
        Make a wish </p>
        Put it to rest in my stomach.
        Calcified thoughts. 
        This eternal lump lodged in my throat,
        Of words I never could say.  
        <pre>


        </pre>
        I’ve been moving rather sluggish recently. 
        Some may say its my diet,
        But my indigestion only weighs me down 
        <pre>

        </pre>So I don’t float away.
