                                                                This week was    rough. I am so tired but I have all my assignments within this next week.
                                                                I've also had a little bit of a time following css completely, I think I may just use html for assignment 2.
                                                                I'm having a hard time centering thigs in css still. I think the way css and html correspond is mixing me 
                                                                up. Hopefully I will feel better about css in a week. Overall, it wasn't a bad week, it was just crazy busy.
