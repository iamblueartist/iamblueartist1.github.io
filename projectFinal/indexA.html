First week websites !
This week I made my first practice website! This is my first time coding
so all of this is new to me. This week I enjoyed adding photos to the html
page, I will make sure to make great use of that newfound knowledge. I do
not yet have access to vs code on my macbook so this week I am not sure
how to write this as an .html page yet. In terms of other things that we
have gone over this week, I am very curious to learn more formatting
skills in the future. I also really enjoyed the website art examples we
were shown in class this week. I particularly like the way a lot of them
were interactive with the audience.
I like this idea of the weekly blog posts in order to see our progress
throughout the next few weeks. I already feel like a coding genius haha.
Maybe I can create a multimedia project at some point with traditional and
internet art in the future.
Overall, this week was really good for me, I was able to create lots of
art throughout the week and learn new forms (such as internet art and
music). I was able to practice guitar which reminds me a lot of coding
actually because it is a very detail oriented instrument and music in
general is like learning a new language, similar to coding which involves
new languages as well.
I had a very nice week and I hope to further my skills next week
(including how to make this an html page on my mac)
