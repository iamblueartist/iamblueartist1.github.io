    <h1>This Week</h1>
    <p>its been a week.  i think?  </p>
        
      <pre>  
This week I finished up my drawing with java project, which I think went well for me and I feel I have an 
overall better grasp of java which I can apply to my final website project. I wish I could've added a few more 
things to the drawing with code assignment but I definately got stuck on what else to add. I feel like making a collage 
often helps with visualization so I will try that next time. Anyway it was a very long week but now is time for break.
