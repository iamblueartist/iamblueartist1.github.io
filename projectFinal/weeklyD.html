This week was quite eventful. In this class I had to research interface for discussion which I was not sure what it was beforehand. 
I did enjoy the article I read for it though. I am also still problem-solving css, I hope I'm improving haha.
I also had 2 other presentations this past week and lots of assignments due. Thankfully I had a fun weekend 
going to live music stuff. But now I'm tired and I have a midterm tuesday so that was short lived. Anyway this week was certainly something..
