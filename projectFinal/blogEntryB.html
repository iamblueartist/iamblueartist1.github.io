                                                          In this class we learned a little bit more about css which was interesting but I think I still have a hard time determining </font>

                                <font color="violet">   Other things that happened this week *before I contracted covid* included going to a Labor Day arts festival.
                                                    There, I bought a belt and some earrings. I am very passionate about my closet and fashion so I can't wait to wear my new accessories!
