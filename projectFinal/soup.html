    I’ve developed a rather 
    <a href="odd.html"> Odd</a> compulsion lately.
    It seems I’ve been swallowing</h1> <h2>stones</h2><h1>
    All shapes and sizes, 
    I lift them up, with forced hesitation 
    And I close my lips around 
    The cold, hard exterior.
    
   
    Take a skipping stone 
    Make a wish 
    Put it to rest in my stomach.
    Calcified thoughts. 
    This eternal lump lodged in my throat,
    Of words I never could say.  
    
 
    I’ve been moving rather sluggish recently. 
    Some may say its my diet,
    But my indigestion only weighs me down 
    
    
    
    
    So I don’t float away.
