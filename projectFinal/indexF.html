    <h1>This Week</h1>  <pre>
<p>        This week I continued to work on my Project one a bit more. I finally figured out how to code the  animation in the background of my main page as blinking stars. 
            There is one problem though... I am not sure how to place anything on top of that animation.
                                        I will contiue to research. 

            Anyway, I now have a basic knowledge of keyframes and the term webkit- which I think helped the site read my keyframes and fixed my problem.
                 I hope to fix my text being covered by animation and I hope to make a shadow thing that follows my mouse on the page next week!
        Overall it was a busy good week and I hope I learn some new thing and celebrate halloween this week.
