    <h1>This Week</h1>
    <p>its been a week.  i think?  </p>
        
      <pre>  
This week we started to go over applying javascript. Like css and html, it has a learning curve so I am still in unfamiliar territory. 
I am particularly confused when it comes to the js file and such. Hopefully I will figure it out before it is due on Wednesday. Other than that 
I'd say that I am pretty excited to learn how to draw in js, and build upon my knowledge. This week was long mentally but short objectively. 
Labor day weekend was refreshing but time to lock in again I suppose...
