This week has felt both excrusiatingly long and too short to get anything done. I am almost done with my final for this class and 
I am pretty proud of how far I have come since the beginning of the semester! I really want to keep developing my skills past this course
and throughout my art career. Perhaps get better at js since I am not fully confident yet.
